# Chess-Playing-AI
Hi Teet, check out my PvP version of my chess app, before AI. There is no draws, en passants, or castleing. Heres how to get it to work (on Mac). Open Terminal and put the following commands in there:

```console
teet@teetsMacbook:~$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

```console
teet@teetsMacbook:~$ brew install git
```

```console
teet@teetsMacbook:~$ brew install sfml
```

```console
teet@teetsMacbook:~$ cd Desktop
```


```console
teet@teetsMacbook:~$ git clone https://github.com/jck1044/Chess-Playing-AI.git
```


```console
teet@teetsMacbook:~$ cd Chess-Playing-AI
```

```console
teet@teetsMacbook:~$ make
```

```console
teet@teetsMacbook:~$ ./chess
```
